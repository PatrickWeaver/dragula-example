# Making drag and drop apps in Thimble with Dragula

### Version: 0.2

This is an example app that uses the Dragula framework for simple, non-persistent drag and drop functionality.

You can add new dragable elements, or drag-to/drag-from areas with css classes.

- Adding the class "box" to any HTML element will make that a place you can drag things into.
- Any child element of a "box" class element is draggable into any other "box" class element.
- You can use your own css classes by changing the script.js file.
